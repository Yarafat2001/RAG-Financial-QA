 ðŸ’¼ RAG Pipeline for Financial Data Question Answering

 This project was developed as part of the **Sigmoix.AI AI R&D Engineer Intern Assessment**. It implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to answer natural language questions using financial documents, specifically **Metaâ€™s Q1 2024 Financial Report**.



ðŸ“Œ Objective

Design and implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- Extracts and processes financial text and tables from a real-world PDF document.
- Embeds both structured and unstructured data for semantic retrieval.
- Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate natural language answers to user queries.
- Incorporates reranking and query optimization for better relevance and accuracy.
